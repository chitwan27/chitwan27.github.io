    <em>Hi, I’m Chitwan!</em>

</div>

<br>
I am a software developer, video maker, and writer based in India. But really, I am a just a human being trying to make sense of this world. I’m a curious and reflective person who loves diving into philosophy, cultural analysis, and anything that helps me understand the world and human behavior better. I’m passionate about creativity- whether it’s coding tools to make life easier, making videos to explain complex topics, or just plain old writing. I enjoy engaging with global perspectives, but having been raised in India, I’m deeply aware of the cultural and societal nuances around me, and try to look at the world from multiple differing lenses. In my free time, you’ll find me geeking out over existentialist philosophy, bingeing Taskmaster, or dreaming about creating something meaningful for the world.
