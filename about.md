I am a software developer, writer, and maker from Punjab, India. But really, I'm a just a human being trying to make sense of this world. I'd describe myself as a curious and reflective person who loves diving into philosophy, media analysis, and anything else that helps me understand the world better. I’m passionate about creativity- whether it’s coding tools to make life easier, making videos to explain complex topics, or just plain old writing. I enjoy engaging with global perspectives, but having been raised in India, am deeply aware of the cultural and societal nuances around me, and try to look at the world from multiple contrasting lenses. In my free time, you’ll find me geeking out over existentialist philosophy, bingeing YouTube, or dreaming about creating something meaningful for the world.
