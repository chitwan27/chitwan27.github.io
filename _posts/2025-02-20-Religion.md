I feel like I should declare at the outset that I am an <strong>atheist</strong>. I do not believe in anything that cannot be justified by <em>hard evidence</em>; this rules out almost everything that is considered <em>spiritual</em> or <em>supernatural</em>. According to me, there is no real truth value in any religion's claims about our physical, material world. The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method" style="font-weight: bold;">scientific method</a> is the best and only tool that we can use to figure out objective truths about our universe. Thanks to science, we can communicate at the speed of light, treat illnesses that used to kill millions, or even send a probe to one of Jupiter's moon. It is absolutely astounding how <strong>science</strong> has allowed us to learn incredible things about ourselves and the universe. Most importantly, science does not ask for blind submission—it is a self-improving process rather than a fixed ideology.

Still, I love learning about religions and systems of belief because these are an undeniable part of the human story. Our religious instincts have inspired both <strong>great</strong> and <strong>terrible</strong> things. The divine narratives and revelations, when seen as interpretable sources rather than the literal gospel, can be very useful for personal and even social moral grounding. Even as a self-professed non-religious person, I cannot help but feel the <strong>awesome beauty</strong> that is alluded to in almost all devotional artifacts. I enjoy listening to religious hymns and songs, even though I know they are not "true." They're able to scratch an itch that seems to me almost biologically ingrained—the primordial search for our place in the universe.

The feeling known as <em><strong>"Mysterium Tremendum et Fascinans"</strong></em> describes the fearful and overwhelming aspects of transcendental religious experience. But I do not believe that religions should have the primary monopoly on the terror and awe associated with divine connection. One should be able to revel in and feel these aspects of human existence via all kinds of different routes. For me personally, <em>art, science, stories, and connections</em> are all equally valid sources of such awesomeness and inspiration as revelation. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" style="font-weight: bold;">The Theory of Evolution</a> is something that tends to have a visceral effect on me. I've even found myself indulging in pseudo-religious rituals, like quoting from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jC-rRPKZ3U" style="color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;">The Lord of the Rings</a> whenever I'm in need of support.

When I say that I am an atheist, some people come to the incorrect assumption that I must hate all aspects of religious expression and am actively crusading to eradicate religion from the face of the earth. So, let me make my stance on this clear: The thing that I am fully against is <u><em>dogma</em></u>—believing things without any reference to <strong>logic</strong> or <strong>evidence</strong>. Religions neither are, nor should be, completely dogmatic; they are just a way to satisfy our evolutionary need for meaning—the yearning for some semblance of absolute truth that is present in all of us. The problem is that some people use the guise of piousness to restrict others by claiming to be in the sole possession of the capital-T <strong>Truth</strong>. That is the thing I fight against.

    One of my strongest beliefs is:<br>There is no <em>absolute</em> moral truth!<br> Values are something we construct ourselves.

<em>Religious experience</em> is an essential part of being human. I just want people to not become restricted by it. Because, I believe that <em>science</em> and <em>art</em> also have an irrefutable role in making us who we are. The human story is <strong>vast</strong> and <strong>multifaceted</strong>. It is very easy in today's day and age to fall into the trap of identity politics and start believing in "us" vs "them" narratives that are manufactured by the higher ups to control us. I just want to posit this to the people who think that their religion should guide their moral philosophy: before believing anyone or anything, try asking yourself just a simple question: Is your religion being used as a vessel for your <span style="color: darkred;">hatred</span> or your <span style="color: darkblue;">compassion</span>?</p>
