In this blog post, I'm going to be ranting about **X**, or the platform formerly known as **Twitter**. For those of us living under a rock, Twitter nowadays is just like alcohol. Some people are able to use it cautiously, but most of us who use it get pathologically addicted to it, and its consumption is injurious to our health. So, why does Twitter suck so much?

Let me start with a crash course on the history of the social internet. In the olden times, before **Web 2.0** and its hellscape of large-scale, many-to-many social media platforms, the internet was decentralized. That is, it was not controlled by large multinational corporations. How many people reading this have heard of **RSS** feeds? (Not _that_ RSS, but Really Simple Syndication RSS.) Tools like RSS allowed people to be in control of what they consumed on the internet. This was the time when blogs, wikis, and indie sites proliferated. Then someone, who is probably extremely rich right now, thought: "What if we could centralize all this independent activity, turn it into a platform where we would be in control of who sees who, and, most importantly, show the users ads and make a lot of money out of it?"

Think about it: Twitter, or any social media platform really, is just a platform. It is the people who use it that make it lucrative by posting and interacting with each other. Twitter's business model is not primarily selling itself to you, but rather selling **_you_** to the advertisers. To maximize their profits, they need to maximize the amount of time you use the platform and your engagement.

Now, here is a basic fact about human psychology: if you hear or see something that is entirely normal and not out of the ordinary, you may be mildly interested in it. But if you hear something that is provocative—something that makes you angry or afraid—your attention is going to remain fixed on that thing, and you're going to feel the urge to engage with it. So, naturally, this kind of content gets promoted on these platforms. Imagine this: anyone can say anything, and the more disturbing the thing is, the more it gets promoted by the algorithm. These kinds of practices that aimed to extract the most profit from users led to the worst kind of content getting promoted on these platforms, especially Twitter. You can clearly see now how Twitter, Facebook, and other social platforms lead to the erosion of shared truth and the rupture of the fabric of reality.

Essentially, Twitter is a mesh of three things: the platform, the people who use it, and the corporation who owns it. And I reckon most of y'all know who owns Twitter—sorry, X—now. It's the world's richest man, **Elon Musk**. Someone who transformed into a right-wing maniac when he wanted to lift lockdowns so his factories could keep working, despite a raging global pandemic. When Elon talked about buying Twitter, he said he wanted to "create a better public town square!" But think about this: do we really want our town square to be controlled and owned by literally the richest and most powerful person in the world? As it turns out, spoiler alert, no we don't.

Elon and his ilk profess to be the messiahs of free speech, but for them, "**_free speech_**" is just a dog whistle for being able to do whatever they want without any critique or opposition. It reminds me of **_Animal Farm_**: "Everybody gets to have free speech, but some people's speech should be more free than others." Instead of a digital town square, X is a free-for-all hellscape. Elon's rise has led to a flood of misinformation and hate speech, from antisemitism to anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. In my opinion, maybe the problem isn't that Twitter is not relentlessly dedicated to the idea of free speech. Maybe the problem is that we, the people, have allowed and invited a private company into the role of a de facto public town square.
