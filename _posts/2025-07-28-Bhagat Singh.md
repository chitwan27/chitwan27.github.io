Bhagat Singh is considered a legend. His name is recognizable to us all. He was a freedom fighter, who fought for our independence from the British. A youthful revolutionary who sacrificed his young life, to free us from the chains of imperial oppression. His violent and direct approach, although drastic was a desperate attempt to awaken those in power, who had grown deaf to the woes of their populace. Jawaharlal Nehru in his wisdom said that, Bhagat Singh did not become popular due to his act of violence, but because by fighting to vindicate the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, he had fought to vindicate the honour of the nation, and thus he became a symbol which reverberated throughout the towns and villages of Northern India.

Bhagat Singh was not just a freedom fighter, he was a revolutionary. He was acutely aware of the oppressive nature of the government of his time. His family was deeply involved in social justice movements since before the time of his birth. He used the push provided by his upbringing and catapulted towards undiscovered horizons. He was a voracious reader from the beginning and remained so till his death. He even came to rethink his relationship with use of violence and its repercussions. We see that his vision was not as monolithic as it is depicted nowadays, and his transformation and evolution is evident in his life's journey.

More than a century has passed since his time, and we seem to have forgotten what actually did he live for and ultimately sacrificed his life for. We have made him an idol and even try to emulate him superficially, while we have totally extricated ourselves from his ideas and his vision. We the people, secure in our middle class lives have forgotten the plight of the workers and the underprivileged. We fixate on the current net worth of the richest individuals on this planet, not realizing that they have achieved their wealth by sucking the life force of the working class. We have indeed become the very thing Bhagat Singh despised the most - capitalist cronies indifferent to the injustices of this system as long as we too can benefit from it.

The ideology of Bhagat Singh as reflected in his writings was of Anarcho-Socialism. Anarchism refers to the dissolution of all oppressive hierarchies, to free the individual from the chains of religion, money and government. For Bhagat Singh real independence could not be achieved, until our society was freed from its inequalities. When the proletariat would get its due, only then the cries of revolution be satisfied. Bhagat Singh was also an atheist, and he staunchly believed in reason and empathy, not the confines of religion. He saw humanity's strength emanating from rational thinking and compassion, not the limits of dogma. He also envisaged a powerful role of the youth of our country, in rising up against the injustices and archaic systems that perpetuated them.

According to the Shaheed E Azam himself, `"The soul of humanity should always be permeated with the spirit of revolution, so that the everlasting march against the reactionaries continues its ever onward march."` To this I say, "Long Live Revolution!"
