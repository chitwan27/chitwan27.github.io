<h1 style="text-align:center;"><u><strong><em>An unexamined life is not worth living. –Socrates</em></strong></u></h1>

Ever since I was little, I have wanted to figure out the ultimate truth about the universe. What is reality? Why are we here? What is the point of life? And so on.  One of the first things I learned in philosophy was the Cartesian dictum, "**Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum**", which means, "I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am." This was (and still is) the best answer to the question, "How do we know anything is real?" The answer is, quite simply, that we don't. There is no way to prove that all your sensory input is not just a simulation or a dream. The only thing that can truly be proven is the fact that at the very least you exist. Because, imagine for a second that you are pondering about the existence of the universe, that experience by itself mandates the existence of you as the ponderer. The very fact that your doubt gives you the certainty of your existence, the only certainty you can have with no doubt, is so damn poetic and elegant. God, I love philosophy! As you can probably imagine, this still doesn't solve much for us. Only being certain of your existence and doubtful about the rest of the universe is a very terrible fate indeed. How do we establish some certitude about the existence of things apart from ourselves? To be blunt, we can't do really do that with logic alone. There is no choice but to *trust* that the sensory information you are receiving is coming from a tangible world and not a hyper-realistic simulation device. But logic doesn't abandon its utility totally yet. 

Let me introduce you to perhaps the most useful logical device at our disposal. **Occam's Razor** to the rescue! When you have multiple competing explanations for the same phenomena, choose the one with the least amount of assumptions (or simply, the explanation that adds the least unnecessary burden). Now we can examine the question whether it is more likely that everything you’re seeing is just an illusion from an unknown source, or that the images you are experiencing are there because your brain is processing the light entering your eyes after getting reflected off the objects in front of you. The first hypotheses has no explanation behind it. Even if we indulge this line of thought, there's no way we could ever know what is making the illusion possible in the first place. The burden of assumptions behind the illusion argument makes it very weak. While the *reality being real* argument is much more convincing simply because it has a more powerful explanation — way less weight of assumptions. This is because modern science can explain stuff thirteen billion years into the past. Even as we keep asking more and more questions, new answers keep on coming. If reality really is a simulation, there's bound to be a glitch in it. But we haven't found any such glitches yet. Gravity weighs the same every day, time keeps flowing at the same rate (in a stationary reference frame), the value of pi keeps getting resolved to arbitrary precision. If the simulation is so convincing that it is indistinguishable from reality, then it makes no sense for us to treat it as anything other than true reality.

So the world is real too. Awesome! What's next? For me the logical next question was, what is the point of it all? Why does the world exist? Why is there something instead of nothing? Science proves really useless in answering these sort of questions. Because science just describes what exists. It does not have the power to tell us why. According to all empirical observation, there is no point to anything. We humans are just another fluke of evolution, having originated via natural selection. A small disturbance in the entropic balance of the universe. There is no why to the universe, no why to life, and no why to you and me. Why do I still have to get out of the bed in the morning then? Homo sapiens is a very unique and strange species. The effects that emerge out of our consciousness, thinking abilities, and shared cultural fictions, are really quite powerful and interesting. Maybe I am biased, but still, just hear me out. We human beings have an exceptional ability to create out of our existence so much stuff that just did not exist before. The plough, the pen, the telescope, the printing press, the Internet, and now the LLMs. But also the paintings, the music, the movies, and the video games. It's absolutely astonishing what our creative powers have done. Our ability to transmit meaning and information has increased so much that experts have started to worry that we might have to scale it back a bit just to get used to it. Perhaps, that is the meaning of our lives. To be a part of this insanely beautiful and interesting story. To make things out of the human spirit which were not there before. It probably doesn't mean anything in the long term, because both as individuals and as a collective we are mortal and temporary, but in the short term it means so freaking much that it's hard to put into words.

The world is really cool and your life is even cooler. But how do you really decide what to do with it? On the one hand you could just keep doing what others tell you to do. Everyone is always very keen to tell you how to live your life. The society that you inhabit probably already has some preferred ideals about what constitutes a good life. On the other hand you could exercise your free will and figure out your own values, ambitions, and paths in life. Both of these options are not equally balanced. One of them is probably much harder on you than the other but it is also perhaps much more meaningful. Say, you are an artist at heart and your family wants you to become a doctor. If you choose to go against their wishes, you might suffer in terms of social validation but gain in terms of personal satisfaction. Is one of them inherently better than the other? I don't think it is very easy to serve a blanket judgement for such a complicated and context dependent choice. Sometimes in life you might choose the easier but less meaningful thing over the harder but more meaningful one. But I do believe that in general more free societies, where individuals are given more agency, are better both for the individuals and for the society as a whole. Human history, after all, has been a story of decreasing power differentials and increasing equity of opportunities. But I don't say that more freedom is better just because of history. I say that because of philosophy. 

About two millennia ago, the philosopher Aristotle posed the question, what gives human beings their essence? The Existentialists, which were a group of philosophers that lived in 20th century Europe, answered that the only thing that can give us our essence is our own consciousness. Existentialism can be described as a movement that centers the primacy of **individual subjectivity** as a lens to explore the human condition. According to them, it is our obligation to create our own personal meaning and purpose in life. Most of us are often guilty of delegating our personal choices and meaning making to the templates that society provides us. According to Jean Paul Sartre, this is us living in “*bad faith*”, wherein we sacrifice our inherent ability to choose for ourselves what our essence really is. In truth, our essence is not what is assigned to us by society, but rather what we craft ourselves, by making our choices freely, with the realisation in mind that the only real authority is our own consciousness. Living in “*good faith*” is the act of rejecting the pressures of any and all external authorities, and imprinting our subjective intentions onto this inherently meaningless universe, by crafting our own meaning. Each choice taken in good faith is the choice that is most in line with one’s honest conception of what gives their life meaning and what purpose they are ultimately living for. It is not the easiest thing to do, but it is the most authentic, because ultimately the only person responsible for your actions is you. Thus, being honest with yourself about what really matters to you is vital in life.

Two and a half centuries ago, Immanuel Kant laid out the **Categorical Imperative**, a philosophical device which helps us give grounding to a humanistic ethics. It states, “Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it becomes a universal law.” In simpler language, it means to only make those choices that we would also want others to make, had they been in our stead. You can't lie in a situation where you wouldn't want others to lie. You can't treat other people as mere means to an end. You have to give respect to their agency and worth as a fellow conscious being. The cool thing is that in most situations we already follow the Categorical Imperative without much conscious deliberation. We humans have an innate urge to be good and morally outstanding. This is why there is social stigma against being a psychopath. We also like to follow established precedents and not go out of line. But, say in a particular situation, if the precedent is not in alignment with the Categorical Imperative, then it becomes our duty to go out of line and start a new paradigm. Imagine if everyone started to properly follow turn indicator etiquette! So now we have in our arsenal the Existential and the Categorical imperatives. One says that we must always strive to be true to our own conception of a meaningful life, and the other says that we must always try to make choices that are universalizable. The first helps us make authentic decisions regarding our own lives and the second one helps us become morally justifiable actors in society.

Existentialism eradicates any *a-priori* values by which to judge our actions, yet there are some fundamental values and ethical preferences that still emerge from this philosophy. It is inauthentic to live in bad faith, to be logically inconsistent, or to be dishonest with oneself about one’s choices. In Existentialism, freedom is the fundamental value from which other values emerge, thus it is sacrosanct. It should be mentioned that despite one’s will to act freely, societal baggage infused in hierarchies of class, creed, gender, etc, prevents an individual from truly expressing themselves. When an individual gives primacy to their own subjectivity, they discover that every other human being is in the same predicament as them. Thus, it is quite important to understand the fact that in a society no individual is free until everyone is. Simone de Beauvoir argued in her work, “The Ethics of Ambiguity” that, **one’s greatest moral imperative is to create their own life’s meaning, while fighting for the freedom for others to do the same**. Thus, Existential living involves fighting with forces both inside and outside oneself, in the quest for achieving true freedom and authenticity. By adopting this point of view, one starts engaging critically and authentically with their life’s choices, and once they start seeing the universality in their individuality, what emerges is a rational, empathetic, and transcendental way of living.

The world that we inhabit right now is a massively unequal and unjust world. Just by being born in a wealthy, developed country, one is likely to have access to significantly more opportunities than a person born in a disadvantaged country. I can go ahead and try to list such the myriad of ways in which a persons circumstance defines and restricts the kind of life that is possible for them. But then I wouldn't have space for saying anything else. The point is that, the ideal vision of Existentialism is not realisable until there is at least some semblance of equality for all human beings. You can't tell a woman in Taliban controlled Afghanistan that she is completely free to do anything, because she isn't. All societies oppress and restrict different groups of people to a varying degree. <u>But all of us, no matter who we are, or where we were born, deserve to have interesting and fulfilling lives.</u> The world, as it is right now, is quite far away from that ideal. This is why we need to use politics to advance the cause of making the world a more free, just, and equitable place. I mean politics not just in terms of our voting power but in a broader all-encompassing sense too. Every single choice we make is political inasmuch as it affects the established power equations around us. Ultimately, power gets derived from individuals. We must express our political agency by questioning the authority of algorithms, corporations, governments, institutions, and social norms that uphold an old and unjust balance of power.

The journey of philosophy is unending — the horizon of questions keeps expanding much faster than the rate at which answers get discovered — but we gotta stop somewhere. The lenses that I've talked about help give direction to our lives but they are not always as disjointed or complementary as we might want them to be. Personally, I've often struggled with making choices that lie at the intersection of these forces when they are pulling in different directions. Still, having a clear conception of these philosophical positions is much better than just blindly going through life. Ultimately, there is no final authority that will tell us what the right choices are. Sometimes you just gotta roll the dice and see how your odds fare. Perhaps that is also part of what it takes to live coherently in a world that never promised us answers.
