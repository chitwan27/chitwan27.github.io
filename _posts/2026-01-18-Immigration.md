Immigration refers to the movement of human beings to foreign locales, usually in search of better socio-economic opportunities. This kind of movement has been a part of the human story from the very beginning, when we left Africa to spread all over the Earth. But as we have matured as a species and gained many advancements, our ideas about immigration have also shifted. In the modern era, as ideas like nationhood have emerged and solidified, immigration has become a highly contentious topic.

The world we live in has vastly different standards of living across different regions. If we believe in the inherent equality of all human beings, then our aim should be to ensure that all people — irrespective of their origins — get the chance to live their lives with dignity. The lottery of birth should not decide who gets to live a good life, and who doesn't. What is wrong then with people, seeking the opportunity for a more dignified life, immigrating to better pastures abroad?

One argument against immigration is that it dilutes the "culture" endemic to a particular place. This argument is an expression of a very narrow conceptualisation of "culture". In actuality, culture is not fixed, it is the ever evolving emergent result of many kinds of human interactions both internal and external to a place. Another red flag against this kind of thinking is that it is usually motivated by animosity against the people groups that are different from us — a basic instinct unfortunately evolutionarily built into humans.

Also prevalent nowadays, is a pseudo-economic argument against immigration that unwittingly favours the locals over the immigrants. It posits that an increase in the supply of workers to an economy causes wages to fall and the standard of living to deteriorate. What this line of reasoning misses is that if immigration causes the standard of living to fall for the locals, it also raises it for the immigrants. In fact economic migration, being an expression of free markets, actually must be beneficial for both the migrants and the locals at-least in a macro sense.

In an ideal world the free movement of people to their place of choice would be a given. The fact that immigration has been so successfully propped up as a point of controversy is expressly due to the unequal nature of the world that we live in today. Whereas the migration of poor people is considered a problem, the wealthy are free to immigrate wherever they want. Ultimately, the issue of immigration is deeply tied to the problem of global wealth inequality and solving it requires tackling that.

For humanists like me, it can be frustrating to engage with the discourse around the politics of immigration. The vitriol and the bad faith politics that is so prevalent, has a tendency to turn us into reactionaries too. It is very important to concede that at the core of this issue, on both sides, are human beings who just want a good life for themselves and those that they care about. What we need to build is a cosmopolitan understanding, because real justice only comes from acknowledging the universal humanity and dignity in all people.
